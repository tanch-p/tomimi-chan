# tomimi.dev
svelte upgrade for prts-chan and to avoid confusion of names with prts.wiki

# Objective:
- To provide users with the most accurate information on stages & enemies stats/abilities in a readable manner and mods applied should be easily verifiable.
- To allow users to search for characters by filtering according to their function/abilities.
- To provide users with a way to view the stage playout in realtime so as to verify the flow/route of enemies.

# Roadmap:

### Operator Recruitment Helper
- v1 coming soon
  
### Enemy Flow
- next
- spine models?
  
### Improved Enemy Look
- after Enemy Flow is done
- Mods applied list for debugging/curiosity
