# tomimi.dev
Currently on Svelte 3.54.0

# Objective:
- To provide users with the most accurate information on stages & enemies stats/abilities in a readable manner and mods applied should be easily verifiable.
- To allow users to search for characters by filtering according to their function/abilities.
- To provide users with a way to view the stage playout in realtime so as to verify the flow/route of enemies.

# Roadmap:

### Operator Recruitment Helper
For enhancements/bugs please file an issue. 
Written in javascript and using json for data
  
### Stage Simulator
Using a localised Spine library (older vers have no npm package) and threejs
Some models here are missing the special texture effects so they look different from in-game.
